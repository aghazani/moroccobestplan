        "<strong>Respectful Attire:</strong> When visiting religious sites and conservative areas, it's important to dress modestly out of respect for local customs and traditions. Avoid revealing clothing and opt for conservative attire such as long pants or skirts and tops that cover the shoulders and knees.",
